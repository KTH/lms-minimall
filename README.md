## Philosophy

This template does not make any assumptions on what kind of application you are building

### What does NOT contain?

Any **feature** or decision:

- Routes. It is up to you to decide how to organise routes and routers
- Template library. You decide if you **need** them and which one to use
- Session handling, authentication, access to database, etc.

### What does contain?

- Configuration files: `.gitignore`, `.prettierignore`, `.dockerignore`, etc.
- Dev dependencies: prettier and eslint for formatting and linting; jest for testing
- NPM commands: `npm test`, `npm run format` and `npm run dev`
- KTH-specific Docker-related files: `docker.conf`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose-unit-tests.yml`, `.dockerignore`
